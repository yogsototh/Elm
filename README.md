Learn about the Elm programming language at [elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evancz/Elm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/evancz/Elm)

## Install

**Arch Linux** &mdash; follow [these directions](https://github.com/evancz/Elm/wiki/Installing-Elm#arch-linux) and then
jump to the [My First Project](#my-first-project) section.
<br/>
**OS X 10.9 or XCode 5** &mdash; follow
[these directions](http://justtesting.org/post/64947952690/the-glasgow-haskell-compiler-ghc-on-os-x-10-9)
before continuing with the platform agnostic directions below.

**Platform Agnostic** &mdash;
download the [Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 or later](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/).
Once the Haskell Platform is installed:

    cabal update
    cabal install elm
    cabal install elm-server

## Use

To use `elm` and `elm-server` you may need to add a new directory to your PATH.

Cabal should tell you where your executables are located upon
successful installation. It'll be something like `/home/evan/.cabal/bin`
which you should append to your PATH variable.
See this tutorial if you are new to changing your PATH in
[Unix/Linux](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-adding-path/).

## My First Project

Now we will create a simple Elm project.
The following commands will set-up a very basic project and start the Elm server.

    mkdir helloElm
    cd helloElm
    printf "import Mouse\n\nmain = lift asText Mouse.position" > Main.elm
    elm-server

The first two commands create a new directory and navigate into it. The `printf`
commands place a simple program into `Main.elm`. Do this manually if you do not
have `printf`. The final command starts the Elm server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/),
allowing you to navigate to `Main.elm` and see your first program in action.

#### Final Notes

The `elm` package provides
[some utility functions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Elm) for
working with Elm in Haskell. This can be useful for creating tooling
for Elm, and has been useful for projects like
[the website](http://elm-lang.org/) and
[`elm-get`](https://github.com/evancz/elm-get). Email the list if you
want to rely on these functions!

If you are stuck, email
[the list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/elm-discuss)
or ask a question in the
[#Elm IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=elm).
